Based on the provided project structure, metadata, and environment information, a CI configuration can be designed to effectively build, test, and lint this project using GitHub Actions. Hereâ€™s a YAML file for setting up a CI/CD pipeline for the PizzaShop Java application:


# FILENAME: .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build-test-lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 30
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # ENVIRONMENT SETUP
    - name: Set up JDK 11
      uses: actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        java-version: '11'
        distribution: 'temurin'

    # DEPENDENCY CACHING
    - name: Cache Maven packages
      uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: ~/.m2/repository
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-maven-${{ hashFiles('**/pom.xml') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-maven-
    
    # LINTING STAGE
    - name: Run Checkstyle
      run: |
        # Check if Checkstyle is configured; if not, set a default
        if [ ! -f checkstyle.xml ]; then
          curl -L -o checkstyle.xml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/master/src/main/resources/google_checks.xml
        fi
        mvn checkstyle:check
      # QUALITY GATE: Fails on style violations

    # BUILD STAGE
    - name: Build project
      run: mvn clean install -DskipTests
      # QUALITY GATE: Fails on compilation errors

    # TEST STAGE
    - name: Run tests
      run: mvn test
      # QUALITY GATE: Fails on test failures

    # Docker build stage (optional if pushing image)
    - name: Build Docker Image
      working-directory: /tmp/repo_940444147_cddd5cca
      run: docker build -t pizzashop:latest .

    # Optional deployment steps could be added here
  

### Key Points:
- **Environment Setup**: The pipeline sets up Java JDK 11, which is compatible with both the Maven build properties and the Docker configuration.
- **Dependency Caching**: It caches the Maven dependencies to speed up subsequent builds.
- **Linting Stage**: It includes a Checkstyle configuration for code style linting. The job retrieves a default Checkstyle configuration if none is provided.
- **Build and Test Stages**: Standard Maven commands are used to build the application and run tests. The build step skips tests for quicker iteration when running `mvn clean install`, with tests run separately to ensure focused feedback.
- **Docker**: The docker build step is included to highlight that this project uses Docker. It can be enabled if you wish to build the Docker image as part of the CI.

This CI configuration is designed to efficiently manage quality gates and provide informative feedback on code changes, ensuring the integrity and maintainability of the project codebase.
